# 🛳️ Web3 Battleship with Vipps SSO

## *Toward Web3: Enhancing User Onboarding and Trust through Vipps SSO*  
*A Master's thesis exploring onboarding and identity in decentralized applications.*

## 🌊 Introduction to the Project

**Web3 can be overwhelming for new users** — cryptographic wallets, gas fees, and decentralized systems can feel intimidating. This project explores how we can make **Web3 more approachable** by introducing a familiar login method: **Vipps SSO**.

We built a fully functional **Battleship game** on the blockchain to test this idea. Through this game, users can:

- Experience **smart contract interactions** in both single- and multiplayer modes.
- Sign in using **Vipps**, without needing to understand private keys or seed phrases.
- Learn about **transactions**, **gas**, and **wallets** in a gradual, playful way.

Our aim is to **bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3** by lowering the entry barrier and building trust through verified identities.

## 🎮 Game Details
- Our Battleship game includes both **singleplayer** and **multiplayer** modes — challenge a bot or compete against a friend.
- Both game modes are powered by **smart contracts** — one for singleplayer and one for multiplayer — ensuring transparent and decentralized gameplay.
- The singleplayer mode is a great way to explore Web3 features at your own pace.
- All actions in the game (like placing ships or making moves) trigger **blockchain transactions**, giving users hands-on experience with decentralized apps.
- When logging in with **Vipps**, the game automatically uses the **Sepolia testnet**, so you can interact with the blockchain without spending real money.
- If you use **MetaMask**, you're free to connect to any Ethereum-compatible network — including Sepolia or even mainnet (though mainnet isn't required or recommended for this game).

## 🔐 Web3 Onboarding with Vipps SSO
To reduce onboarding friction, this project integrates **Vipps SSO** to allow users to sign in using a familiar Web2 login method — no wallet setup or private key management required. Here's how it works:

1. The user logs in using Vipps through an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
2. We retrieve the user's unique sub identifier from Vipps, which acts as their identity reference.
3. We check if this user already has a private key stored in our database.
4. If not, we generate a new **Ethereum-compatible private key**, store it in our MongoDB database, and return it to the frontend.

This private key enables users to sign blockchain transactions without requiring them to manually interact with a wallet. While simplified, this architecture functions similarly to a lightweight **Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS)** solution, helping onboard users into Web3 without requiring them to manage keys or install tools like MetaMask.

## 🔍 Web3 and Game Overview

### ⚓️ What is Web3?
- **Web3** is a *new way of thinking* about the internet — focused on **decentralization** and **user control**.
- Unlike **Web2**, where large companies store your data, Web3 uses **blockchain networks** run by independent nodes.
- This gives you greater **transparency**, **privacy**, and **ownership** of your identity and data.

### 🔐 Login using Vipps vs MetaMask
- **MetaMask** is a popular Web3 wallet where **you manage your own private key**.
- If you lose your private key, you lose access — permanently.
- To make things easier, we offer **Vipps Login** — a method many users already know and trust.
- It’s perfect for beginners: **no wallet setup, no seed phrases, just play!**

### 🪙 What are Transactions?
- In Web3, actions like **placing ships** or **attacking** are blockchain **transactions**.
- Each transaction requires a small fee called **"gas"**, used to securely process actions on the network.
- Some actions interact with **smart contracts** — self-executing programs that guarantee fairness and transparency.

### 💸 Do I Need Real Money?
- **No real money is needed!**
- The game runs on the **Sepolia testnet**, using **fake ETH** for testing and experimentation.
- You can explore blockchain features **completely free** — *no cost, no risk.*

### ✨ Our Goal
- We want to make Web3 **accessible and intuitive** — especially for newcomers.
- By using **familiar login options like Vipps**, we reduce friction and make it easier to get started.
- You’ll experience the **core benefits of Web3** without needing deep technical knowledge.
